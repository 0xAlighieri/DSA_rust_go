## INTRO

This repo is essentially my attempt to recreate all the data structures and algorithms discussed in ThePrimeagen's Frontend Masters course
but implemented in both Rust and Go. The purpose of this exercise is two-fold: to get more familiar with DSA, but also with the Rust and Go
programming languages. What better way to learn two languages than by implementing DSAs from scratch? heh..heh....ugh..
